    - WHY :: :: ::
        - So we can write robust code
        - this class is required
        - find vulnerabilities before criminals
    - WHAT:
        - SPP : Secure Programming Practices
            - Priciples of Secure Programming
            - Robust Programming
            - Defensive Programming
            - Programming Flaws
            - Static Analysis
            - Different Programming languages
        - SSA : Software Security Analysis
            - Testing Methodologies 
            - Static and Dynamic Analysis Techniques
            - Sandboxing
            - Common Analysis tools and methods
        - QAT : QA/Functional Testing
            - Testing Methodologies
            - Test Coverage Analysis
            - Automatic and manual generation of test inputs
            - Test execution
        - (bonus: STRIDE)
            - S: Spoofing identity
            - T: Tampering with data
            - R: Repudiation
            - I: Information disclosure
            - D: Denial of service
            - E: Elevation of privilege
    - DELIVERABLES
        - Produce Software Security Analysis tools and Techniques
        - Apply knowledge to perform Software Security Analysis, using common tools 
        - etc.
