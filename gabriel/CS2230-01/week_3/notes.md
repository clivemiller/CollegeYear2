# ELF â€“ Executable and LInkable Format

- common standard file format for executable files, object docs, shared libraries, and core dumps.

# RUGGED MEMORY

- Uses less memory
- Simply declare your char array as a dynamic variable (`char *p[2]`) instead of a static one (`char *a[2][15]`).

# STATIC VARIABLES

- Static variables that are not explicityly initialized in thier declarations are initialized to 0 at run time.
- Initialized static variables and the uninitialized static variables occupy different sections in the program image.
- Typically, initialized static variables are part of the executable module on disk, but the uninitialized static variables are not.
  - The automatic variables are not part of the executable module because they are only allocated when their defining block is called.
  - The initial values of automatic variables are undetermined unless the program explicitly initializes them.
- Static variables can make a program unsafe for threaded execution. For example, the C library function `readdir()` and its relatives use static variables to hold return values.
- The function `strtok()` uses a static variable to keep track of its progress between calls.
- Neither of these functions can be safely called by multiple threads within a program.
  - They are not thread-safe
  - External static variables also make code more difficult to debug because successive invocations of a function that references a static variable may behave in unexpected ways.
  - Thus, avoid using static variables except under controlled circumstances.
